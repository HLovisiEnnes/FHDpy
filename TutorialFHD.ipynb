    "This notebook deals with the data structure for Heegaard diagrams described in [arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11406). We strongly advise the reader to first check `TutorialSLP.ipynb`, as many methods of that module will be implicitly or explicitly used here.\n",

    "The main idea of `FHDpy` is to give us a data structure to represent closed 3-manifolds that is significantly more compact (in fact, sometimes exponentially) than the usual representation of 3-manifolds using **triangulations**.  For such, we will use Heegaard splittings. In a snipshot, a **Heegaard splitting** is given by a pair $(\\Sigma_g, \\phi)$, where $\\Sigma_g$ is the (unique up to homeomorphism) closed surface of genus $g$ and $\\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $\\Sigma_g\\to\\Sigma_g$, often restrcited to the mapping class group of $\\Sigma_g$, $\\text{Mod}(\\Sigma_g)$, i.e., considered only up to isotopies. One can imagine obtaining the 3-manifold by gluing two handlebodies of boundary $\\Sigma_g$ using $\\phi$ as a gluing map. In particular, we can always assume that $\\phi$ is a word in some finite alphabet consisting of Dehn twists about Lickorish generators and can be thus described as a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Twister` module of `SnapPy` allows for getting a triangulation out of a Heegaard splitting of a 3-manifold. For example, it is a well-known fact that the 3-sphere $S^3$ has a Heegaard splitting for $g=1$ (i.e., $\\Sigma_g$ is the torus) with $\\phi = b$ where $b$ represents the Dehn twist about one of the two Lickorish generators of the torus, in this case, the meridian of the torus (the purple curve in the image below)."

    "In FHD, we can represent this same diagram in two ways, `FHD_genus1` and `FHDLong`. As the name indicates, although `FHDLong` can be used to find Heegaard diagrams of 3-manifolds over general surfaces, `FHD_genus1` can be used only to represent 3-manifolds that have splittings over the torus (also known as lens spaces). Starting with the more general one, `FHDLong`, it allows one to express the cellular complex for $\\Sigma_g=T^2$. This syntax assumes four mandatory arguments and one optional. The mandatory are:\n",
